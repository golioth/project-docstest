# CircuitPython Introduction

## Overview

We are using CircuitPython to have an “out of the box” experience for trying out the Golioth Cloud. Our goal is to have the trainee sending data packets back to Golioth as fast as possible. We will go through some simple exercises using CircuitPython before switching over to Zephyr. 

We will be reviewing 3 of the 4 Golioth features currently available:
* Logging
* LightDB State
* LightDB Stream

## Installing the pre-configured CircuitPython bootloader
